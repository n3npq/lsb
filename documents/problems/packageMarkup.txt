LSB Specification

Problem Statement:
------------------

The existing LSB Package Standard specifies a format (which hasn't
changed this century) and a tag content enumeration (most of which
has not changed this century, the major exception is RPMTAG_FILENAMES),
but doesn't address the problem of package metadata sufficiently directly.

The specification (and the tools based on the spec) forbid certain
tags (RPMTAG_TRIGGERS), constrain other values (i.e. only
	Requires: lsb >= X.Y
is permitted), and ignore other tags. This generally leads to
an arbitrary specification that cannot be usefully implemented
in any version of RPM.

The metadata in a package (not just RPM) is moderately complicated,
and largely invisible because hidden with a binary format.




(Proposed) Solution:
--------------------

Choose a markup format that displays all of the metadata in a package.

RPM (all versions of RPM since rpm-3.0.6) includes a very
simple XML markup to dump all the metadata in a package. The
existing widely deployed XML markup can be seen by typing, say,
     rpm -q --xml bash

A very short example that displays all 5 XML tags is:

<rpmHeader>
  <rpmTag name="Headeri18ntable">
	<string>C</string>
  </rpmTag>
  <rpmTag name="Sigsize">
	<integer>924592</integer>
  </rpmTag>
  <rpmTag name="Sigpgp">
	<base64>iQIVAwUAUefxoglG/KLBBbneAQKTdw/9FHsbBZxBWb7OM4v1+QJBPe6rUTYr9tWu

</base64>

A sed(1) script could be used if any of
	<rpmHeader>
	<rpmTag name ="...">
	<string>
	<integer>
	<base64>
are deemed too rpm-centric for package markup. The real goal of
using markup instead of binary packages is an attempt to unify
the representation of a package -- including dpkg -- in a WYSIWYG
format that is much easier to examine and understand.

The hope is that better testing tools can be written using the
markup (rather than packages) as input, and that the non-LSB
*.deb packages might be usefully included.

There are of course many other markups, including JSON/YAML, that
might be useful. I have described the --xml markup
which is already widely deployed in RPM.

Solution Discussion Links:
--------------------------

THere are endless discussions of the relative merits of *.rpm vs *.deb
that have occurred over the years, mostly without any deep or complete
understanding of what metadata is contained in a package.


Solution Rationale:
------------------

The --xml option was added to rpm in order to supply a WYSIWYG
complete specification of what is in a LSB *.rpm package.


Distributions Support:
----------------------

All distro's that use rpm (that I know of) include the --xml option.


Verification Test:
------------------

Validation tests for the generated XML can be undertaken as needed.
